# Your Place in the World of the Eternal Vanguard

Welcome to Golarion in the year 5000 AV (After Vanguard). You were born during a time known as "The Stagnant Era," a period marked by the absolute rule of the Eternal Vanguard. As a child blessed - or perhaps cursed - with the "Deja Vu" ability, your life has been far from ordinary. 

## The Eternal Vanguard

The Eternal Vanguard is the sole governing power in Golarion. They rose to prominence centuries ago, guiding humanity through tumultuous times. Over the years, they established a firm grip on society, shaping it according to their principles of social welfare, hard work, and justice.

The Vanguard is led by the Grand Arbiter, a figure revered for their wisdom and dedication to the greater good. Beneath the Grand Arbiter is the Council of Stewards, a group of senior leaders who oversee the daily operations of the Vanguard. In each region, a Regional Advocate represents the Vanguard's interests, while local chapters are managed by Wardens of the People. 

The Vanguard's influence can be seen in every aspect of life. They control education, dictating what is taught in schools and universities. They manage the economy, ensuring that resources are distributed according to their vision of fairness and equality. They are the arbiters of justice, with Justiciars overseeing the legal system.

## Life Under the Vanguard

For most citizens, life under the Vanguard is all they have ever known. The Vanguard's principles are drilled into children from a young age, and questioning the status quo is heavily discouraged. Conformity is rewarded, while dissent is swiftly punished.

Society is rigidly structured, with each person's role and station determined by the Vanguard. Social mobility is rare, and most people are expected to follow in their parents' footsteps. The Vanguard's word is law, and their decisions are not to be questioned.

Yet despite the Vanguard's iron grip, whispers of discontent have begun to surface. Rumors circulate of strange occurrences, unexplained events that the Vanguard is quick to suppress. Some even dare to dream of a world free from the Vanguard's control. But such thoughts are dangerous, for the Vanguard has eyes and ears everywhere.

## Your Unique Situation

As a child with the "Deja Vu" ability, you have always been different. Your episodes of déjà vu are vivid and frequent, often leaving you with a sense of unease. You can't shake the feeling that the world is not as it should be, that something is amiss.  

The Vanguard took a keen interest in you from a young age. They claimed it was for your own wellbeing, that your abilities made you unique in a world of conformity. Your parents, loyal citizens of the Vanguard, did not resist when you were taken into "protective" custody for education.

## Defiance and Imprisonment

Despite the Vanguard's best efforts, you couldn't ignore the growing sense that something was fundamentally wrong with the world. The more they tried to mold you into a loyal servant, the more you resisted.

Your rebellious nature did not go unnoticed. The Justiciars grew increasingly frustrated with your lack of compliance, and their methods became harsher and more punitive. Eventually, they deemed you a lost cause and a potential threat to their order.

As a result, you now find yourself in a high-security prison, designed specifically for individuals like you who have dared to defy the Vanguard. Here, the Vanguard hopes to keep you isolated and controlled, preventing you from spreading your dangerous ideas and disrupting their carefully crafted society.
