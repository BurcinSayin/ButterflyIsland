# Temporal Dream Link
**Rare Occult Ritual**  
**Cast** 1 day; **Cost** rare incense, crystals, and herbs worth 1,000 gp; **Secondary Casters** 2  
**Primary Check** Occultism (expert); **Secondary Checks** Arcana, Society  
**Range** planetary; **Target** one creature outside the Bastion  
**Duration** 1 week  

This ritual allows the casters to initiate a psychic link with a target creature, enabling communication through dreams. The ritual must be cast from within the Bastion.

To target a creature, the casters must know at least three of the following:
- The creature's true name
- The creature's exact heritage (including parentage, place of birth, and time of birth)
- The creature's precise location in time and space at the moment of casting
- A personal item that holds deep emotional significance to the creature
- A detailed physical description of the creature, including any unique identifying marks
- The creature's deepest, darkest secret
- The creature's greatest fear or desire
- The name and nature of a powerful entity (deity, demon lord, archfey, etc.) that the creature is closely associated with

The more information the casters possess, the stronger the link:
- 3 pieces of information: The DC of the primary check is increased by 2.
- 4-5 pieces of information: The DC of the primary check is normal.
- 6-7 pieces of information: The DC of the primary check is reduced by 2.
- All 8 pieces of information: The DC of the primary check is reduced by 4, and the duration is doubled.

**Critical Success** The link is established. Every night for the next week when the target falls asleep, the casters can initiate a vivid dream communication. The target recalls the dream with perfect clarity upon waking.

**Success** As critical success, but the link lasts for only 1d4 days.

**Failure** The ritual fails to establish the link. The casters are mentally strained and are stupefied 2 for 1 day.

**Critical Failure** The psychic energies of the ritual backfire on the casters. They fall into a coma for 1d4 days and are stupefied 4 for 1 week after waking. The target experiences terrible nightmares for the next week.

**Special**
- The casters can choose to appear in a familiar or comforting guise within the dream to set the target at ease. Alternatively, they can use a fictional guise to hide their identities.
- The target can attempt a Will save to resist the dream communication. On a success, they realize they are dreaming and can choose to wake up, ending the communication prematurely. On a critical success, they can block any future communication attempts from that casting of the ritual.
- The link cannot be used to directly harm the target. However, the information and experiences conveyed through the dreams can still have mental and emotional impacts. 

**Heightened (+1)** The cost increases by 1,000 gp, the primary skill DC increases by 2, and the duration increases by 1 week.
