# Ritual: Temporal Regression
*Rare Occult Ritual 10*

**Cast** 1 day; **Cost** rare reagents worth 10,000 gp; **Secondary Casters** 3
**Primary Check** Occultism (legendary); **Secondary Checks** Arcana, Lore (Chronomancy)
**Range** 10 feet; **Targets** one or more willing creatures
**Duration** instantaneous

Originally created by the legendary Emperor Xin, this powerful ritual allows the casters to send willing targets backward in time. However, each use causes a minute fragment of cosmic energy ( fragment of YOG-SOTHOTH ) to seep into the material plane, slowly altering the fabric of reality.

**Critical Success** The targets arrive at the intended destination in the past without any ill effects, able to act immediately.

**Success** The targets safely arrive at the destination time but are disoriented, taking 3d6 mental damage and becoming stunned 3.

**Failure** The ritual fails to transport the targets through time. Any rare reagents are consumed. The targets suffer 6d6 mental damage and are stunned for 1 minute.

**Critical Failure** The time travel goes disastrously wrong. The targets take 10d6 mental damage and vanish without a trace. The casters are unable to determine if the targets traveled to an alternate timeline, were erased from history, or met some other grim fate.

## Special
- This ritual cannot be used to travel to any time before -6400 AR.
- Once this ritual has been used to send targets to a specific point in time, it cannot be used by anyone to travel to an earlier date.
- This ritual cannot be used to travel to the future. The flow of time can only be navigated backward, never forward.
- Repeated use of this ritual causes subtle changes to the fabric of reality ( because it causes a tiny fragment of YOG-SOTHOTH's essence to scatter to Golarion on every use ) :
  1. The ritual's use contributes to the birth of children with the "Deja Vu" ability, who have an innate sensitivity to temporal fluctuations.
  2. People across Golarion may experience strange, prophetic dreams or nightmares.
  3. Magical effects, especially those related to divination or temporal manipulation, become increasingly unpredictable.

## Heightened (12th) 
The cost increases to 20,000 gp. On a success, the targets arrive without any ill effects. On a failure, the targets take 6d6 mental damage and are stunned for 1 minute, but the time travel succeeds.

Key notes and guidelines:
- The ritual requires extensive knowledge of occult magic and the fundamental forces governing space and time. Only casters with master proficiency in Occultism can hope to perform it successfully.
- The rare reagents serve as both material components and temporal anchors, helping guide the targets through the turbulent timestream. Without them, the ritual cannot function.
- Travel to the distant past is inherently more dangerous than short temporal jumps. The GM determines the DC based on the temporal displacement involved.
- Time travelers risk encountering past versions of themselves or other time travelers. Extreme caution must be taken to avoid unwanted interactions that could rupture the timestream.
- The mental strain of time travel is immense and can break even the strongest minds. Travelers must steel their resolve before attempting such a perilous journey.
- The global restriction on travel to earlier dates applies to all users of the ritual, not just the initial travelers. This represents the delicate nature of the timestream and the risk of paradoxes from multiple alterations to the past.
