# Ritual: Temporal Regression
**Temporal Regression**\
**Rare Occult Ritual**\
**Cast:** 1 day; **Cost:** rare reagents worth 10,000gp; **Secondary Casters:** 3\
**Primary Check:** Occultism (master); **Secondary Checks:** Arcana, Lore: Chronomancy\
**Range:** 10 feet; **Target:** one or more willing creatures\
**Duration:** instantaneous

This powerful and complex ritual allows the casters to send willing targets backward in time.

**Critical Success:** The targets arrive at the intended destination in the past without any ill effects, able to act immediately.

**Success:** The targets safely arrive at the destination time but are disoriented, taking 3d6 mental damage and becoming stunned 3. Creatures that critically fail their Will save become temporarily insane for 1d4 days.  

**Failure:** The ritual fails to transport the targets through time. Any rare reagents are consumed. The targets suffer 6d6 mental damage and are stunned for 1 minute. Creatures that critically fail their Will save become permanently insane.

**Critical Failure:** The time travel goes disastrously wrong. The targets take 10d6 mental damage, become permanently insane, and vanish without a trace. The casters are unable to determine if the targets traveled to an alternate timeline, were erased from history, or met some other grim fate. 

### Special: 
- Once this ritual has been used to send any targets to a specific point in time, it cannot be used by anyone to travel to an earlier date. This global restriction helps prevent paradoxes and limits the potential for multiple groups altering the past.
- This ritual cannot be used to travel to the future. The flow of time can only be navigated backward, never forward.

Key notes and guidelines:
- The ritual requires extensive knowledge of occult magic and the fundamental forces governing space and time. Only casters with master proficiency in Occultism can hope to perform it successfully.
- The rare reagents serve as both material components and temporal anchors, helping guide the targets through the turbulent timestream. Without them, the ritual cannot function.
- The fate of the timestream lies in the casters' hands. Altering history risks creating paradoxes or alternate timelines.
- Travel to the distant past is inherently more dangerous than short temporal jumps. The GM determines the DC based on the temporal displacement involved.
- Time travelers risk encountering past versions of themselves or other time travelers. Extreme caution must be taken to avoid unwanted interactions that could rupture the timestream.
- The mental strain of time travel is immense and can break even the strongest minds. Travelers must steel their resolve before attempting such a perilous journey.
- The global restriction on travel to earlier dates applies to all users of the ritual, not just the initial travelers. This represents the delicate nature of the timestream and the risk of paradoxes from multiple alterations to the past.
