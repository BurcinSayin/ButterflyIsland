# Divine Power Siphon
*Rare Occult Ritual 9*  
**Traditions** occult  
**Cast** 1 day; **Cost** rare incense and offerings worth 10,000 gp; **Secondary Casters** 3  
**Primary Check** Occultism (master); **Secondary Checks** Religion, Arcana  
**Range** 1 mile; **Targets** one dead or weakened deity whose portfolio is within 1 mile  
**Duration** permanent  

This blasphemous ritual allows the casters to siphon a portion of a dead or severely weakened deity's power and imbue it into chosen mortal vessels. It requires access to an area that was strongly aligned to the deity's portfolio.

**Critical Success** The ritual siphons a significant portion of the target deity's remaining essence. This energy can be shaped to grant supernatural abilities to a number of willing individuals equal to the primary caster's Occultism modifier. These abilities are thematically tied to the deity's domains and can range from potent spells to divine physical enhancements.  

**Success** The ritual manages to siphon a modest portion of the deity's power, enough to grant abilities to a number of individuals equal to half the primary caster's Occultism modifier (minimum 1).

**Failure** The ritual fails to establish a connection to the deity's fading essence. The rare incense and offerings are wasted with no effect.

**Critical Failure** The attempt to siphon divine power backfires spectacularly. The primary caster takes 10d6 negative energy damage as the deity's power turns against them. The area becomes spiritually contaminated, making future attempts at this ritual far more dangerous.
