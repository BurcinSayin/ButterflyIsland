# Ritual: Temporal Jump
**Temporal Jump**\
**Rare Occult Ritual**\
**Cast:** 1 day;\
**Cost:** rare reagents worth 10,000gp; **Secondary Casters:** 3\
**Primary Check:** Occultism (master); **Secondary Checks:** Arcana, Lore: Chronomancy
**Range:** 10 feet; **Target:** one willing creature with the "Déjà Vu" ability\
**Duration:** varies

This intricate ritual allows the casters to send a willing target with the "Déjà Vu" ability backward in time. The ritual must be performed in a place isolated from the normal flow of time, such as a pocket dimension or a location saturated with temporal magic.

**Critical Success:** The target arrives at the intended destination in the past without any ill effects, able to act immediately. When the duration ends, they instantly return to the ritual's location in the present.

**Success:** The target safely arrives at the destination time but is disoriented, taking 3d6 mental damage and becoming stunned 3. When the duration ends, they return to the present, suffering the same effects.

**Failure:** The ritual fails to transport the target through time. Any rare reagents are consumed. The target suffers 6d6 mental damage and is stunned for 1 minute.

**Critical Failure:** The time travel goes disastrously wrong. The target takes 10d6 mental damage and vanishes without a trace. The casters are unable to determine if the target traveled to an alternate timeline, was erased from history, or met some other grim fate.

### Special:
- This ritual can only target living creatures with the "Déjà Vu" ability. Non-living materials and creatures without this ability cannot be affected. 
- The target's unique connection to the timeline allows them to travel to any point in time, even before their birth or after their death. However, traveling to such extremes is incredibly taxing, causing an additional 2d6 mental damage upon arrival and return.
- The duration of the travel is determined by the casters during the ritual. At the end of the duration, the target automatically returns to the location and time where the ritual was performed.
- Traveling to the distant past or future is more taxing. For every century traveled, the target takes an additional 1d6 mental damage upon arrival and return.
- If the location where the ritual was performed is compromised while the target is in the past or future, their return point becomes a random location within 1 mile. 
- Paradoxes created by the target's actions in the past or future are mitigated by the ritual's magic, causing history to "self-correct" in minor ways. However, major changes can still drastically alter or erase the present timeline.
