**Description** 
Chrono-Stalkers are one of the many unique species that have evolved in the temporal anomalies of the Bastion. These small predators have adapted to navigate the unstable timestreams of their home, using their limited temporal abilities to hunt and evade danger.

Chrono-Stalkers are drawn to individuals with the "Deja Vu" ability, sensing the minor temporal disturbances these people create. While not typically aggressive towards humans, they can be territorial and may attack if they feel threatened or cornered.

Butterfly Valley has learned to coexist with these creatures, recognizing their value as natural indicators of temporal disturbances in the Bastion.
