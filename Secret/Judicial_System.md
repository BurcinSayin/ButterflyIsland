# Judicial System

## 1. Adaptable Structure
- **High Court:** Each kingdom's highest judicial authority, overseen by a Vanguard-appointed Chief Justiciar.
- **Provincial Courts:** Handle major cases within provinces or large cities.
- **Local Courts:** Address day-to-day legal matters in smaller communities.

## 2. Justiciars
- Trained legal professionals, vetted and certified by the Eternal Vanguard.
- Serve as judges at all levels, adapting to local customs while upholding Vanguard principles.
- Local rulers may nominate candidates, but final approval comes from Vanguard representatives.

## 3. Unified Legal Code
- **The Vanguard Codex:** A core set of laws embodying fundamental Vanguard principles of order, duty, and social welfare. This serves as the constitutional foundation for all legal systems.
- **Local Legal Frameworks:** 
  - Each kingdom or major region has the authority to develop and maintain its own comprehensive legal code.
  - Local laws can address specific cultural, economic, and social needs of the area.
  - Regional authorities have significant latitude in crafting laws for issues not directly addressed by the Vanguard Codex.
- **Compatibility Check:**
  - All local laws must be compatible with the Vanguard Codex.
  - A council of local leaders and Vanguard representatives reviews new laws to ensure they don't conflict with core Vanguard principles.
- **Flexible Interpretation:** 
  - Local Justiciars are trained to interpret and apply laws in a manner that respects both Vanguard principles and local customs.
  - In cases of ambiguity, local precedent can be considered as long as it doesn't fundamentally contradict the Vanguard Codex.
- **Regular Reviews:**
  - Periodic reviews of local legal codes are conducted to ensure ongoing alignment with Vanguard ideology.
  - These reviews also provide opportunities for local authorities to propose updates or amendments to their laws.
- **Innovation Encouragement:**
  - The Vanguard actively encourages local legal innovation that furthers the goals of social order and welfare.
  - Successful local legal strategies may be shared and implemented in other regions if deemed universally beneficial.

## 4. Flexible Trial Process
- Inquisitorial system as standard, but accommodates local traditions where necessary.
- Juries permitted in some regions, but final decisions rest with Vanguard-trained Justiciars.
- Defense advocates allowed, with Vanguard oversight to ensure "proper" representation.

## 5. Graduated Punishments
- **Correction Centers:** For minor offenses, focusing on realignment with Vanguard and local authority principles.
- **Community Service:** Emphasizes contribution to society, adaptable to local needs.
- **Exile or Imprisonment:** For serious crimes, with conditions set by local authorities and approved by Vanguard representatives.

## 6. Information Network
- Collaboration between local law enforcement and Vanguard agents.
- Encourages citizen reporting while respecting local social structures.

## 7. Special Cases Management
- Protocols for handling individuals with unusual abilities (e.g., "Deja Vu"), adaptable to local beliefs.

## 8. Tiered Appeals Process
- Initial appeals handled at the local or provincial level.
- Final appeals can be elevated to the kingdom's High Court.
- Vanguard reserves the right to intervene in cases of "significant importance."

## 9. Standardized Legal Education
