# Eternal Vanguard's Old Gods Policy

## Introduction

The Eternal Vanguard's primary goal is the eradication of all divine influence on Golarion. However, their approach to surviving deities is nuanced, balancing pragmatism with their long-term objectives. This document outlines the Vanguard's policy towards the remnants of the old pantheon.

## Tolerated Deities

The following deities may be temporarily tolerated by the Eternal Vanguard, as their influence can be manipulated to further the Vanguard's goals:

1. **Norgorber (God of Thieves and Secrets)**
   - Potential use: Intelligence gathering, covert operations
   - Approach: Cautious manipulation of Norgorber's networks

2. **Calistria (Goddess of Trickery, Lust, and Revenge)**
   - Potential use: Social control, population distraction
   - Approach: Manipulate aspects of lust and revenge to keep populace divided

3. **Urgathoa (Goddess of Gluttony, Disease, and Undeath)**
   - Potential use: Population control through disease, covert undead agents
   - Approach: Controlled outbreaks, limited use of undead for specific operations

4. **Zon-Kuthon (God of Darkness and Pain)**
   - Potential use: Fear tactics, deterrent against rebellion
   - Approach: Contain influence to specific areas, use as psychological weapon

## Actively Opposed Deities

The following deities are considered significant threats and are actively targeted for elimination:

1. **Desna (Goddess of Dreams, Stars, Travelers)**
   - Threat: Promotes freedom and exploration, opposes control of information
   - Countermeasures: Strict regulation of travel, suppression of dream-related phenomena

2. **Groetus (God of the End Times)**
   - Threat: Inspires apocalyptic cults, destabilizes society
   - Countermeasures: Aggressive suppression of end-times prophecies, elimination of cultists

3. **Lamashtu (Mother of Monsters)**
   - Threat: Creates chaos, disrupts orderly society
   - Countermeasures: Eradication of monsters, purge of corrupted areas

4. **Rovagug (God of Destruction)**
   - Threat: Fundamental opposition to Vanguard's order
   - Countermeasures: Immediate and ruthless opposition to any sign of influence

## Overall Strategy

The Eternal Vanguard's tolerance of any divine entity is strictly limited and conditional:

1. **Infiltration:** Place agents within "tolerated" cults for monitoring and manipulation.
2. **Misdirection:** Use divine influence as smokescreen for Vanguard activities.
3. **Controlled Opposition:** Allow limited cult activity to create illusion of religious freedom.
4. **Gradual Erosion:** Slowly replace divine worship with Vanguard ideology over time.

The ultimate goal remains the complete eradication of all divine influence. Any "tolerance" is a temporary, strategic decision subject to constant re-evaluation.
