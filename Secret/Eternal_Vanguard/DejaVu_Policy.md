# Eternal Vanguard Deja Vu Policy
The Eternal Vanguard would view children exhibiting the "Deja Vu" ability with a mix of intrigue, caution, and calculated opportunism.

## Public Reaction:
Publicly, the Vanguard would express concern for these children, framing their abilities as a consequence of the ongoing Temporal Crisis. They might offer to provide special care and education for these children, positioning themselves as benevolent guardians. This would align with their public image as a force for social welfare and protection.

## Secret Reaction:
Privately, the inner circle of the Vanguard would be extremely interested in these children. As masters of time manipulation themselves, they would recognize the potential power and usefulness of individuals with an innate connection to the flow of time. They would likely seek to bring these children under their control, to study their abilities and potentially groom them as future agents of the Vanguard.

### Possible Actions:
1. Identification and Monitoring: The Vanguard would use its extensive network of informants to identify children displaying signs of "Deja Vu". They would then closely monitor these children and their families.

2. "Protective" Custody: Under the guise of providing special care and protection, the Vanguard might take these children into custody, separating them from their families. This would allow the Vanguard to control the children's development and education.

3. Indoctrination and Training: The children would be subjected to intense indoctrination into the ideals and goals of the Eternal Vanguard. They would be trained to use their abilities in service of the Vanguard's agenda.

4. Experimental Studies: The Vanguard's Chronomancers would likely conduct extensive studies on these children, seeking to understand the nature and extent of their abilities. This might involve subjecting the children to various tests and experiments.

5. Integration into the Vanguard: Those children who prove loyal and useful to the Vanguard would likely be integrated into the organization, becoming part of the next generation of Vanguard agents and potentially even future leaders.

For the children deemed unsuitable for indoctrination, the Eternal Vanguard would likely take a pragmatic and ruthless approach, prioritizing the secrecy and security of their organization above all else.
Depending on the specific reasons for a child's unsuitability, the Vanguard might take the following actions:

1. Memory Alteration: If a child's inability to be indoctrinated stems from strong attachments to their family or pre-existing beliefs, the Vanguard might use their time manipulation abilities to alter the child's memories. They could erase the child's recollection of their "Deja Vu" experiences and replace them with false memories that would make the child less resistant to the Vanguard's influence. This would be a way to "reset" the child and start the indoctrination process anew.

2. Permanent Containment: If a child proves utterly resistant to indoctrination and is seen as a potential threat to the Vanguard's secrecy, they might be subjected to permanent containment. This could involve imprisonment in a secret Vanguard facility, where the child's abilities could be suppressed or neutralized. In extreme cases, the Vanguard might use their time magic to trap the child in a temporal stasis, effectively removing them from the timeline altogether.

3. Elimination: In the most extreme cases, where a child is deemed an immediate and serious threat to the Vanguard's plans, elimination might be considered as a last resort. This could involve arranging "accidents" or simply causing the child to vanish without a trace. The Vanguard's mastery over time would allow them to cover their tracks and manipulate events to avoid suspicion.

The decision on which approach to take would likely be made by the Council of Shadows, weighing the potential risks and benefits of each option. The High Chronomancer would have the final say, as they would be most attuned to potential ripple effects in the timeline.

These actions would be carried out with utmost secrecy, known only to the highest echelons of the Vanguard's leadership. To the outside world, including most of the Vanguard's own followers, these children would simply disappear, their fates obscured by the Vanguard's web of lies and temporal manipulation.

It's important to note that these actions are a reflection of the Eternal Vanguard's villainous nature in this alternative timeline. Their treatment of these children, who are seen as little more than resources to be exploited or threats to be eliminated, highlights the cruel and calculating nature of the organization beneath its benevolent public facade.

## Deja Vu Detection

The Eternal Vanguard employs various methods to detect individuals with Deja Vu abilities, all presented under the guise of public welfare initiatives:

1. Educational screening: Mandatory testing in schools to identify children with special needs or talents.

2. Public health initiatives: Regular health check-ups including subtle tests to identify those with Deja Vu experiences.

3. Community outreach programs: Events and workshops encouraging people to share unusual experiences.

4. Encouragement of self-reporting: Promoting the idea that Deja Vu experiences signify a special connection to Vanguard ideals.

5. Training for public officials: Justiciars, Wardens of the People, and other representatives are trained to recognize signs of Deja Vu abilities.

These methods are presented as part of the Vanguard's commitment to public welfare and identifying individuals who might need special attention or have unique contributions to make to society. The true extent and nature of their detection methods remain closely guarded secrets of the Vanguard.
