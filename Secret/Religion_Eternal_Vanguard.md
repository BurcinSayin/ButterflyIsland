## Public Agenda
The Eternal Vanguard presents itself as a religion dedicated to the upliftment and empowerment of all people. It emphasizes the importance of hard work, justice, and the well-being of society. Followers are encouraged to contribute to their communities, support social welfare programs, and fight against oppression. They believe that through diligence and cooperation, a utopian society can be achieved where everyone is free to pursue their dreams.

## Secret Agenda
Unbeknownst to the general public and rank-and-file members, the Eternal Vanguard's true goal is to eradicate all gods on Golarion and free the world from divine influence. The inner circle, led by the enigmatic **High Chronomancer**, possesses ancient time-manipulation magic known as "Temporal Regression," which they use to subtly alter events and consolidate their power.

The High Chronomancer, through a forbidden ritual, can siphon a portion of a dead god's power and influence. This stolen divine essence is then used to grant divine spells and powers to the Vanguard's true believers and high-ranking members, furthering their loyalty and devotion to the cause.

## Public Practices
- Community Service: Followers regularly engage in public works, building infrastructure, providing aid to the needy, and organizing educational programs.
- Rituals of Labor: Ceremonies celebrating the dignity of work and the unity of the community are held frequently.  
- Festivals of Freedom: Annual celebrations where the successes of the community are honored, and the ideals of freedom and justice are reinforced through parades, speeches, and communal feasts.

## Secret Practices
- Time Manipulation: The inner circle conducts clandestine rituals to manipulate the flow of time, subtly altering events to their advantage and undermining the influence of the gods.
- Harvesting Divine Power: When a god dies, the High Chronomancer performs a secret ritual to siphon a portion of the dead deity's power, which is then distributed among the Vanguard's elite.
- Infiltration and Sabotage: Vanguard agents infiltrate rival religious organizations and nations, gathering intelligence and sowing discord to weaken their opposition.

## Public Leadership and Hierarchy
- Grand Arbiter: The supreme leader who guides the overall vision and strategy of the religion. They are seen as the embodiment of the Vanguard's principles.
- Council of Stewards: Senior leaders elected by the clergy and followers. They govern the daily operations of the religion across different regions.
- Regional Advocates: Each region or major city has a Regional Advocate who oversees the religion's activities in that area. 
- Wardens of the People: Dedicated leaders who manage local chapters or congregations. They are the direct point of contact for most followers.
- Justiciars: Appointed to ensure the principles of justice and fairness are upheld within the Vanguard's operations.
- Acolytes and Advocates: Entry-level followers who are actively involved in the daily activities and rituals. Advocates are experienced members with additional responsibilities. 

## Secret Leadership and Hierarchy
- High Chronomancer: The true leader of the Eternal Vanguard, possessing the power of Temporal Regression and overseeing the secret agenda of eradicating the gods.
- Council of Shadows: A select group of powerful Chronomancers and trusted agents who lead the Vanguard's covert operations and maintain the facade of the public religion.
- Tempus Inquisitors: Elite agents trained in both divine magic and chronomancy, tasked with hunting down threats to the Vanguard and protecting its secrets at all costs.

## Role in Golarion
The Eternal Vanguard operates primarily in urban centers, where it can easily blend its public works with its clandestine activities. Its followers are drawn mainly from the working and middle classes, attracted by its message of social justice and self-improvement. 

Behind this benevolent facade, the Vanguard's inner circle works tirelessly to unravel the power of the gods, manipulating time and harvesting divine power to further their ultimate goal of a world free from divine influence, where the Vanguard reigns supreme.
