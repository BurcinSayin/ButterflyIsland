# Faelyn Thell'quassir

## Public Information

**Name:** Faelyn Thell'quassir
**Race:** Elf
**Class:** Ranger
**Age:** 247
**Occupation:** Forest Warden of Iadara's Refuge

### Description
Faelyn is a tall, lean elf with weathered features and keen, forest-green eyes. His long silver hair is often tied back in a practical braid. He moves with the quiet grace of one accustomed to navigating dense forests.

### Background
Faelyn has served as a Forest Warden of Iadara's Refuge for over a century. He's known for his deep knowledge of the Fierani Forest and his skills in tracking, survival, and combat. Faelyn is respected among the elven community for his dedication to preserving the forest and protecting the enclave.

### Personality
Reserved and dutiful, Faelyn is known for his unwavering commitment to his responsibilities. He's a man of few words but great action, preferring to lead by example. Despite his stoic exterior, he's known to have a gentle touch when dealing with the flora and fauna of the forest. Recently, some have noticed a hint of worry in his eyes, especially when matters concerning education or his son are brought up.

### Family
Faelyn is a single father to Surin Thell'quassir. His wife disappeared under mysterious circumstances many years ago. He rarely speaks of her, a fact attributed to his private nature and the pain of loss. Despite his initial reluctance, Faelyn allowed Surin to attend Starfall Academy, recognizing the importance of education in the modern era of Iadara's Refuge.

## Secret Information

### True Background
Faelyn's role as a Forest Warden is genuine, but it also serves as a cover for his covert activities. He's part of a small, secret network of elves who are skeptical of the Eternal Vanguard's rule and work to preserve true elven lore and magic.

### Wife's Disappearance
Faelyn's wife, Elowen, was a Deja Vu individual. When Surin began showing signs of the same ability, Elowen attempted to flee with him, fearing the Vanguard's interest. She was caught and "disappeared" by the Vanguard. Faelyn was given a cover story about her being called away on a mission.

### Memory Manipulation
The Vanguard used their chronomancy to alter Faelyn's memories of Elowen's disappearance. However, the process wasn't perfect, leaving him with a sense of unease and fragmented, contradictory memories that he struggles to reconcile.

### Relationship with House Nightveil
Faelyn is under constant, covert surveillance by agents of House Nightveil. They see him as a potential threat due to his wife's actions and his son's abilities. Unbeknownst to Faelyn, one of his trusted ranger colleagues is a House Nightveil informant.

### Hidden Knowledge
Over the years, Faelyn has gathered scraps of information suggesting the Vanguard's true nature. He keeps a secret journal encrypted in an ancient elven cipher, hidden in a hollow tree deep in the forest.

### Starfall Academy Situation
Faelyn was deeply opposed to sending Surin to Starfall Academy, fearing it would expose his son to heavy Vanguard indoctrination. However, he was given no choice in the matter. Vanguard officials, citing the enclave's laws on mandatory education, insisted that Surin attend. Refusing would have raised suspicions and potentially exposed Faelyn's secret activities. 

To maintain his cover and protect Surin, Faelyn reluctantly agreed, but not without taking precautions:

1. He intensified Surin's home education in true elven lore and traditions during breaks and holidays.
2. He taught Surin subtle techniques to question information and think critically without drawing attention.
3. He established a secret code with Surin to communicate privately, disguised as innocent father-son talk.

### Current Goals
1. Uncover the truth about his wife's disappearance
2. Protect Surin from the Vanguard's influence, especially at Starfall Academy
3. Preserve and pass on true elven heritage
4. Gather evidence of the Vanguard's manipulation of elven society
5. Find a way to remove Surin from Starfall Academy without arousing suspicion

### Inner Conflict
Faelyn now struggles not only with his duties as a Warden but also with the daily anxiety of sending his son into what he perceives as enemy territory. He grapples with the fear that each day at the Academy pulls Surin further from his true heritage and closer to Vanguard control. This added stress has made him more prone to long, solitary patrols in the forest, where he can temporarily escape his worries and plan his next moves.
