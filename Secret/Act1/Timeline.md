This is an alternative timeline for Golarion which Aroden was never been born and Ethernal Vanguard filling the power vacuum. This is the main timeline change made by the Eternal Vanguard
AR reference according to original Golarion Calendar before the time manipulation was made (Absalom Reckoning). Publicly it is used as "Before Vanguard" (BV) and "After Vanguard" (AV). -1 BV is equal to -1 AR and 1 AV is equal to 1 AR.

1. Earthfall (-5293 AR): The cataclysmic event still occurs, but without Aroden to raise the Starstone and guide humanity, the recovery is much slower and more difficult.
2. Rise of the Eternal Vanguard (-5000 AR): In the chaos following Earthfall, the Eternal Vanguard emerges as a powerful force, offering aid and stability to the struggling peoples of Golarion. They begin to establish a network of influence across the Inner Sea region.
3. Foundation of Vanguard City (-4500 AR): The Eternal Vanguard establishes a grand city on the site where Absalom would have been. This city, known as Vanguard City, becomes a major center of trade, learning, and Vanguard power.
4. The Quiet Century (-4000 to -3900 AR): The Eternal Vanguard works to consolidate its power and influence, using its time manipulation abilities to subtly alter events in its favor. Religions and cults spring up in the power vacuum left by Aroden's absence, but none can match the Vanguard's growing might.
5. The Golden Age of the Vanguard (-3500 to -3000 AR): Vanguard City becomes the undisputed center of civilization in the Inner Sea region. The Vanguard's public works and social welfare programs earn them great loyalty from the common people, while their secret magics allow them to outmaneuver any rivals.
6. The Gradual Decline (-3000 to -2000 AR): As millennia pass, the Eternal Vanguard begins to face challenges. Some of the gods and their followers begin to grow suspicious of the Vanguard's true nature. Rival nations and factions start to emerge, challenging the Vanguard's hegemony.
7. The Time of Troubles (-1000 AR): Open conflict erupts between the Eternal Vanguard and a coalition of gods and their mortal followers. The Vanguard's time manipulation powers give them an edge, but the gods are still immensely powerful. The conflict throws the Inner Sea into chaos.
8. The Triumph of the Vanguard (1 AR): After a long and terrible conflict, the Eternal Vanguard defeats the coalition of gods and their followers. Many of the gods are slain, their power broken forever. The survivors flee into hiding, their influence drastically diminished.
9. The Great Revision (1 to 100 AR): With their mastery of time magic, the Eternal Vanguard begins to rewrite history. They erase all traces of the gods' influence, altering memories and records to make it seem as if the gods never existed. The Vanguard positions itself as the sole guiding force in Golarion's history.
10. The Age of the Vanguard (100 to 1000 AR): Under the Vanguard's rule, Golarion enters a new era. The Vanguard's principles of social welfare, hard work, and justice become the governing ideology. Vanguard City becomes the undisputed capital of the world, a gleaming metropolis where the Vanguard's will is law.
11. The Eradication of Magic (500 AR): To cement its power, the Eternal Vanguard begins a campaign to eradicate all forms of magic not under its control. Arcane schools are shut down, magical creatures are hunted to extinction, and practitioners of unapproved magic are harshly persecuted.
12. The Rise of the Chronocracy (1000 to 3000 AR): As centuries pass, the Eternal Vanguard evolves into a true Chronocracy - a government that rules through its mastery of time. The inner circle of the Vanguard becomes a dynasty of Chronomancers, each one passing down the secrets of time manipulation to their chosen successor.
13. The Stagnant Era (3000 to 5000 AR): Under the Chronocracy's absolute rule, Golarion settles into a state of stagnation. The Vanguard's mastery of time allows it to predict and prevent any threats to its power. Society becomes rigidly structured and resistant to change.
14. The Temporal Crisis (5000 AR): The Eternal Vanguard's constant manipulation of time begins to take its toll on the fabric of reality. Strange temporal anomalies and paradoxes start to occur with increasing frequency. The Chronomancers struggle to maintain control.
15. The Shattering of Time (5000 AR and beyond): In a cataclysmic event, the contradictions in Golarion's heavily revised timeline reach a breaking point. Time itself fractures, splitting into countless divergent realities. The Eternal Vanguard's rule ends in chaos, and Golarion is left a broken, divided world, its true history lost forever.
