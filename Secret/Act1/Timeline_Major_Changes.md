Based on the information provided, I'll analyze which regions would be most critical for the Eternal Vanguard to control before their Triumph. I'll consider strategic, magical, and cultural importance in this assessment.

1. Absalom: Known as the City at the Center of the World, Absalom would be a crucial target due to its:
   - Central location and importance as a trade hub
   - Magical significance (the Starstone Cathedral)
   - Political influence across the Inner Sea region

2. Nex and Geb: These magically advanced nations would be high-priority targets:
   - Access to powerful arcane knowledge and artifacts
   - Control over undead forces (in Geb)
   - Potential for magical resources to fuel the Vanguard's time manipulation

3. Thassilon (Varisia): The remnants of this ancient empire would be crucial:
   - Access to powerful Thassilonian magic and runelords' secrets
   - Control over significant magical sites and artifacts
   - Strategic location for expansion

4. Kyonin: The elven kingdom would be important to control:
   - Access to ancient elven magic and knowledge
   - Control over a significant non-human population
   - Strategic location in the Inner Sea region

5. Numeria: This land of super-advanced technology would be vital:
   - Access to otherworldly technology and knowledge
   - Potential for integrating technology with magic
   - Strategic resources and innovations

6. Osirion: This ancient nation holds significant importance:
   - Access to ancient magical knowledge and artifacts
   - Control over powerful divine and pharaonic magic
   - Strategic location for expansion into Garund

7. Cheliax: While currently a significant power, controlling it would be crucial:
   - Access to infernal resources and connections
   - Control over a major naval power
   - Strategic location and influence in the Inner Sea

8. Ustalav: This nation would be important for its:
   - Occult knowledge and connections to the Dark Tapestry
   - Proximity to the Worldwound (potential source of chaotic energy)
   - Strategic location bordering several key regions

These regions would likely be the Eternal Vanguard's top priorities due to their magical, strategic, and cultural significance. Controlling them before the Triumph would provide the Vanguard with the resources, knowledge, and strategic positions needed to consolidate their power and reshape Golarion according to their vision.
