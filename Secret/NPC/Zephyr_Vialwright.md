# Zephyr Vialwright - The Temporal Alchemist's Legacy

## Basic Information
**Name:** Zephyr Vialwright
**Race:** Gnome
**Class:** Alchemist (Research Scientist)
**Age at sacrifice:** 137
**Alignment:** Neutral Good

## Appearance
Zephyr is a gnome of average height with wild, shock-white hair that seems to defy gravity, often sticking out in all directions as if he's been electrocuted. His eyes are a brilliant, shifting green that occasionally gleam with an inner light when he's excited about a new discovery. His skin has a faint, iridescent sheenâ€”a side effect of his constant exposure to temporal reagents. He wears a lab coat covered in countless pockets, each filled with vials, tools, and mysterious gadgets.

## Background
Zephyr Vialwright was always fascinated by the mysteries of time and its effects on matter. His research led him to develop unique alchemical concoctions that could subtly influence the flow of time around objects. This work caught the attention of Ariadne Timeweaver, who recognized the potential applications for chronomancy.

## The Final Sacrifice
Zephyr Vialwright, along with Ariadne Timeweaver and Eoghan Moonseer, sacrificed his life during the ritual to create the Bastion. His expertise in alchemy and chronomantic reagents was crucial in stabilizing the demiplane's unique temporal properties.

## Legacy
Though Zephyr is no longer physically present, his contributions to Butterfly Valley and the Bastion continue to have a profound impact:

1. His alchemical innovations form the foundation of many of the Bastion's systems, including the "Timeless Preservation" process that allows organic matter to exist indefinitely in the demiplane.

2. The "Temporal Resistance Elixirs" he developed continue to protect Butterfly Valley agents during time travel missions.

3. His research notes and unfinished projects are carefully preserved in the Bastion's archives, providing valuable insights for future generations of alchemists and chronomancers.

4. The Essence Distillation Apparatus, his final creation, remains a crucial component in maintaining the Bastion's stability and powering many of its unique features.

## Lasting Influence
Zephyr's eccentric brilliance and dedication to the cause of Butterfly Valley continue to inspire its members. His portrait hangs in the Bastion's main laboratory, and many alchemists and researchers report feeling a spark of inspiration when working on particularly challenging problems, as if Zephyr's innovative spirit still lingers in the Bastion.

## Relationships
- **Ariadne Timeweaver:** Zephyr viewed Ariadne as a kindred spirit. There is a portrait of her in his lab.
- **Eoghan Moonseer:** Zephyr respects Eoghan's wisdom but sometimes found the seer's cryptic prophecies frustrating. They had a friendly rivalry, often debating the merits of science versus divination.
