# Zephyr Vialwright - The Temporal Alchemist

## Basic Information
**Name:** Zephyr Vialwright
**Race:** Gnome
**Class:** Alchemist (Research Scientist)
**Age:** 137 (appears to be in his 50s due to his experiments)
**Alignment:** Neutral Good

## Appearance
Zephyr is a gnome of average height with wild, shock-white hair that seems to defy gravity, often sticking out in all directions as if he's been electrocuted. His eyes are a brilliant, shifting green that occasionally gleam with an inner light when he's excited about a new discovery. His skin has a faint, iridescent sheen—a side effect of his constant exposure to temporal reagents. He wears a lab coat covered in countless pockets, each filled with vials, tools, and mysterious gadgets.

## Background
Zephyr Vialwright was always fascinated by the mysteries of time and its effects on matter. His research led him to develop unique alchemical concoctions that could subtly influence the flow of time around objects. This work caught the attention of Ariadne Timeweaver, who recognized the potential applications for chronomancy.

## Key Achievements
1. Development of Chrono-catalysts, essential reagents for temporal manipulation rituals
2. Creation of the "Timeless Preservation" process, allowing organic matter to exist indefinitely in the Bastion
3. Invention of "Temporal Resistance Elixirs" to protect agents during time travel
4. Design of the "Essence Distillation Apparatus," crucial for Ariadne's creation of the Bastion

## Role in Founding Butterfly Valley
Zephyr's expertise was instrumental in making Butterfly Valley and the Bastion possible. His alchemical innovations provided the material components necessary for Ariadne's most ambitious chronomantic rituals. During the creation of the Bastion, Zephyr worked tirelessly to stabilize the demiplane's unique temporal properties, ensuring it could sustain life outside the normal flow of time.

## Personality
Zephyr is brilliant, eccentric, and perpetually curious. He has a tendency to speak rapidly, often jumping between topics as his mind races from one idea to the next. Despite his sometimes erratic behavior, he is deeply committed to the cause of Butterfly Valley and feels a strong sense of responsibility for the safety of its inhabitants.

## Current Projects
1. Refining the Temporal Jump ritual to reduce mental strain on travelers
2. Developing an alchemical solution to enhance the "Deja Vu" ability in potential recruits
3. Creating a "Temporal Tracker" to detect manipulations in the timeline by the Eternal Vanguard

## Relationships
- **Ariadne Timeweaver:** Zephyr viewed Ariadne as a kindred spirit and was devastated by her sacrifice. He keeps a portrait of her in his lab and often talks to it when working through difficult problems.
- **Eoghan Moonseer:** Zephyr respects Eoghan's wisdom but sometimes finds the seer's cryptic prophecies frustrating. They have a friendly rivalry, often debating the merits of science versus divination.

## Secrets
1. Zephyr has been experimenting with his own version of temporal regression on a small scale. He hasn't told anyone, fearing the ethical implications.
2. He keeps a hidden journal detailing alternative histories he remembers—events that seem to have been erased or altered in the current timeline.

## Weaknesses
- His enthusiasm sometimes leads him to overlook potential dangers in his experiments.
- Zephyr struggles with insomnia, often working for days without rest when engrossed in a project.
- He has a habit of testing experimental concoctions on himself, leading to occasional bizarre side effects.
