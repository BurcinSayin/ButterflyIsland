# Eoghan Moonseer - The Spectral Prophet of Time

## Basic Information
**Name:** Eoghan Moonseer
**Race:** Human (formerly), now a Spectral Entity
**Class:** Wizard (Divination School)
**Age at death:** 78
**Current state:** Sentient spirit residing in the Bastion
**Alignment:** Neutral Good

## Appearance
Eoghan is an elderly man with a long, flowing white beard and deep-set eyes that seem to hold the wisdom of ages. He walks with the aid of a gnarled staff, adorned with various arcane symbols and a crystal orb at its top. His robes are simple but elegant, decorated with subtle patterns resembling constellations and flowing timelines.

## Background
Born with an exceptional gift for divination, Eoghan Moonseer has spent his life honing his abilities to see beyond the present. His visions have grown more powerful and far-reaching over the years, allowing him to perceive potential futures with remarkable clarity.

## The Sacrifice and Transformation
Eoghan, along with Ariadne Timeweaver and Zephyr Vialwright, sacrificed his life during the ritual to create the Bastion. However, due to his unparalleled mastery of divination magic and his deep connection to the flow of time, Eoghan's consciousness persisted as a sentient spirit within the Bastion.

## Current Role
As a spectral entity, Eoghan continues to guide the members of Butterfly Valley. His form is ethereal, often manifesting as a shimmering, translucent figure or sometimes just a disembodied voice. He can appear throughout the Bastion but is most strongly present in the areas dedicated to divination and strategic planning.

## Abilities as a Spirit
- Unhindered by physical limitations, allowing him to observe multiple areas of the Bastion simultaneously
- Enhanced divination abilities, with the potential to perceive possible futures with even greater clarity
- Ability to communicate with Butterfly Valley members through visions, dreams, and direct manifestation
- Limited ability to interact with the physical world, primarily through the manipulation of the Bastion's inherent magical energies

## Key Prophecies and Actions
1. Predicted the rise of the Eternal Vanguard decades before their formation
2. Foresaw the Time Crisis and the Vanguard's future attempts to manipulate the timeline
3. Prophesied the emergence of individuals with the "Deja Vu" ability
4. Founded Butterfly Valley as a preparation for the coming temporal crisis
5. Developed methods to identify and locate individuals with the "Deja Vu" ability

## Secrets and Mysteries
1. Temporal Sensitivity: While not possessing the "Deja Vu" ability himself, Eoghan has developed an acute sensitivity to temporal fluctuations, allowing him to sense when major changes to the timeline occur.

2. The Prophecy Chamber: Within Butterfly Valley's headquarters, Eoghan has created a special chamber that amplifies his divination abilities, allowing for more detailed and far-reaching visions.

3. Contingency Visions: Eoghan regularly experiences visions of potential futures where he is no longer present, allowing him to prepare Butterfly Valley for various scenarios.

## Current Goals
- Continue to provide guidance and predictions to Butterfly Valley
- Identify and recruit more individuals with the "Deja Vu" ability
- Develop strategies to prevent the Eternal Vanguard from achieving their goals
- Prepare Butterfly Valley for multiple potential future scenarios
- Train a successor who can interpret his prophecies after he's gone

## Weaknesses
- The strain of his powerful visions takes a heavy toll on his mind
- His prophecies, while accurate, can sometimes be misinterpreted due to their cryptic nature
- The weight of knowing potential futures often leads to periods of depression and moral dilemmas
