# Ariadne Timeweaver

## Basic Information
**Name:** Ariadne Timeweaver
**Race:** Human
**Class:** Wizard (Chronomancer)
**Age at sacrifice:** 45
**Alignment:** Neutral Good

## Appearance
Ariadne was a striking woman with long, silver hair that seemed to shimmer with an otherworldly quality. Her eyes were a deep, penetrating blue that appeared to shift and swirl like the currents of time itself. She often wore robes of midnight blue adorned with intricate silver patterns resembling clockwork and constellations.

## Background
Ariadne Timeweaver was a prodigy in the arcane arts, particularly in the manipulation of time. Her insatiable curiosity led her to uncover ancient tomes and forgotten rituals, ultimately leading to her discovery of the existence of thTemporal Regression ritual. Recognizing both its potential and its dangers, she sought out Eoghan Moonseer, a renowned diviner, to help her understand the implications of this power.

## Key Achievements
1. Discovery of the Temporal Regression ritual
2. Co-founder of Butterfly Valley alongside Eoghan Moonseer
3. Creator of the Bastion, a demiplane outside of normal time
4. Pioneer of several time-related magical theories and spells

## Relationship with Eoghan Moonseer
Ariadne and Eoghan formed a deep friendship and partnership based on mutual respect and a shared vision. While Ariadne provided the raw power and knowledge of time manipulation, Eoghan's prophetic abilities helped guide their actions. Together, they foresaw the rise of the Eternal Vanguard and the potential catastrophic consequences of unchecked time manipulation.

## The Founding of Butterfly Valley
After consulting with Eoghan and witnessing his visions of a dystopian future ruled by the Eternal Vanguard, Ariadne proposed the creation of Butterfly Valley. This organization would serve as a bastion of hope and resistance against those who would abuse the power of time manipulation.

## Creation of the Bastion
Ariadne's crowning achievement was the creation of the Bastion, a demiplane existing outside the normal flow of time. She realized that to truly protect Butterfly Valley from the Eternal Vanguard's temporal manipulations, they needed a base of operations beyond the reach of conventional time travel.

The ritual to create the Bastion was immensely complex and dangerous. Ariadne knew it would require a sacrifice - her own life essence to anchor the demiplane and keep it stable. Despite Eoghan's protests, she was resolute in her decision, seeing it as the only way to secure a future for their cause.

## The Sacrifice
In a heartrending ceremony, Ariadne performed the ritual to create the Bastion. As the magic reached its crescendo, she used her mastery over time to unravel her own personal timeline, dispersing her life essence across the newly formed demiplane. Her physical form dissolved into motes of silver light, becoming one with the Bastion itself. This act not only created the Bastion but also cost Ariadne her life, along with her colleagues Eoghan Moonseer and Zephyr Vialwright.

## Legacy
Although physically gone, Ariadne's presence can still be felt throughout the Bastion. Those sensitive to temporal energies sometimes report sensing a comforting, guiding presence. Her sacrifice ensured that Butterfly Valley would have a safe haven from which to operate, and her discoveries continue to form the foundation of their efforts against the Eternal Vanguard.
