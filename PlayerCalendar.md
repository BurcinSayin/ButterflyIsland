# The Vanguard Calendar (VC)
The calendar is divided into two main eras: Before Vanguard (BV) and After Vanguard (AV). The year of the Eternal Vanguard's triumph over the gods is considered year 0, marking the transition from BV to AV.

Each year is divided into 12 months, named after key concepts of the Vanguard:

1. Freedomrise
2. Dutyhold
3. Welfaretide
4. Justiceflow
5. Laborshine
6. Wealthgrow
7. Ambitionflame
8. Destructionfall
9. Secretshadow
10. Timeshift
11. Revisiondawn
12. Triumphcrest

Each month has 30 days, for a total of 360 days in a year. The remaining 5 days (6 in leap years) are special holidays spread throughout the year:

Day of Vanguard's Rise (1st of Freedomrise)
Eternalight (15th of Laborshine)
Remembrance of the Fallen (10th of Destructionfall)
Revelations Eve (30th of Secretshadow)
Day of Ascension (30th of Triumphcrest)
Time's Blessing (leapyear day, added after the Day of Ascension every 4 years)


## Timeline
1. **Earthfall (-5293 BV):** The cataclysmic event still occurs, but the recovery is much slower and more difficult without powerful figures to guide humanity.

3. **Foundation of Vanguard City (-4500 BV):** The Eternal Vanguard establishes a grand city that becomes a major center of trade, learning, and Vanguard power.
4. **The Golden Age of the Vanguard (-3500 to -3000 BV):** Vanguard City becomes the undisputed center of civilization in the Inner Sea region. The Vanguard's public works and social welfare programs earn them great loyalty from the common people.
5. **The Gradual Decline (-3000 to -2000 BV):** As millennia pass, the Eternal Vanguard begins to face challenges. Rival nations and factions start to emerge, challenging the Vanguard's hegemony.
6. **The Triumph of the Vanguard (1 AV):** After a long period of conflict, the Eternal Vanguard defeats its rivals and consolidates its power. The Vanguard positions itself as the guiding force in Golarion's future.
7. **The Age of the Vanguard (100 to 1000 AV):** Under the Vanguard's rule, Golarion enters a new era. The Vanguard's principles of social welfare, hard work, and justice become the governing ideology. Vanguard City becomes the undisputed capital of the world, a gleaming metropolis where the Vanguard's will is law.
8. **The Eradication of Magic (500 AV):** To cement its power, the Eternal Vanguard begins a campaign to regulate all forms of magic. Arcane schools are brought under strict control, and practitioners of unapproved magic are persecuted.
9. **The Era of Eternal Guidance (1000 to 3000 AV):** As centuries pass, the Eternal Vanguard's rule becomes more entrenched and bureaucratic. The leadership of the Vanguard becomes a dynasty, with power passed down through generations of powerful families.
